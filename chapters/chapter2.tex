Consider the sequence
\begin{equation}
x_n = (-1)^n, n \geq 1.
\end{equation}
Then for $\epsilon > 2$, it is true that $\abs{x_n - 0} < 2, \forall n \geq 1$.

The \textit{vercongent} definition describes a sequence that can be finitely bounded past some $n$.

\bx{
For $\epsilon > \frac{1}{2}$, we can find a suitable $N$, since we can claim the sequence ``converges'' to $\frac{1}{2}$. For $\epsilon \leq \frac{1}{2}$, there is no suitable response.

	\begin{align*}
		\abs{\pbra{\pbra{\frac{1}{n}}}} &\leq 0 \\

	\end{align*}
	\item $\lim a_n = 0$. Take $n > 10$. Then 
	\begin{align*}

}

Usually, the sequence converges to some value by getting closer and closer eventually. Sometimes, the sequence converges to the exact value very fast, which means for some $n$, we don't need to choose a larger $n$. E.g. if we had the sequence of all 0s, we can choose any $n$ and claim the sequence converges to 0.

	\item With our definition, we say this sequence diverges, but does not converge to $\infty$.

	\item Frequently.
	\item Eventually is stronger, and implies frequently.
	\item We say that a sequence $x_n$ converges to $x$ if it eventually is in a neighborhood of radius $\epsilon$ of $x$ for all $\epsilon > 0$.
	\item $x_n$ is only necessarily frequently in $(1.9, 2.1)$.

\begin{equation*}
    |\sqrt{x_n}| = \frac{|x_n|}{|\sqrt{x_n}|} < \frac{1}{|\sqrt{x_n}|}\epsilon|\sqrt{x_n}| = \epsilon

By the Order Limit Theorem, since

	\forall n, z_n \leq y_n \Rightarrow \lim_{n\to\infty} y_n \leq \lim_{n\to\infty} z_n = l

AFSOC $\lim a_n = l_1$ and $l_2$, for $l_1 \neq l_2$. Then we have that $\forall \epsilon > 0$, for sufficiently large $n$, that
\begin{align*}
	\abs{a_n - l_1} < \epsilon \\
	\abs{a_n - l_2} < \epsilon

But this is a contradiction, since if we let $d = \abs{l_1 - l_2}$, and $\epsilon = \frac{d}{2}$, then 
\begin{align*}
	\abs{l_2 - l_1} \leq \abs{a_n - l_1} + \abs{-(a_n - l_2)} < 2 \epsilon \\
	d \leq \abs{a_n - l_1} + \abs{-(a_n - l_2)} < d,

($Rightarrow$) If $(z_n)$ is convergent to some $l$, then $\forall \epsilon >0$, we have that $\exists N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for $n \geq N$, that 
\begin{equation}
	\abs{z_n - l} < \epsilon \lra \abs{x_n - l} < \epsilon,  \abs{y_n - l} < \epsilon,
\end{equation}
because $z_n$ appears before or at the same time as $x_n$ and $y_n$ in the sequence.

($\Leftarrow$) If $(x_n), (y_n)$ are both convergent to some limit $l$, then we have for some $n\geq N \in \mathbb{N}$, that 
\begin{align*}
	\abs{x_n - l} &< \epsilon \\
	\abs{y_n - l} &< \epsilon.
\end{align*}
Then choose $n' \geq 2N$, then we have two cases, 
\begin{itemize}
	\item If $n'$ odd, then $z_{n'} = x_{(n'+1)/2}$. Since $\frac{n'+1}{2} \geq N$, $\abs{x_{(n'+1)/2} - l} < \epsilon$.
	\item If $n'$ even, then $z_{n'} = y_{n'/2}$. Since $\frac{n'}{2} \geq N$, $\abs{y_{n'/2} - l} < \epsilon$.

In both cases we have that for every $\epsilon > 0$, we can find $n' \geq N' = 2N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that

No. Consider $a_n = \frac{1}{n}, a_n > 0$. $\lim a_n = 0$, but $0 \not> 0$.

\bx{
Let $\lim x_n = x$. Then, for some $n_\epsilon \geq N$, we have $\abs{x_n - x} < \epsilon/2$. Now,
\begin{align*}
	\abs{y_n - x} &= \frac{1}{n}\pbra{\abs{\sum_{i=1}^{n_\epsilon}(x_i - x)} + \abs{\sum_{i=n_\epsilon}^n (x_i - x)}} \\
	&= \frac{n_\epsilon}{n}\underset{i\in[1,n_\epsilon]}{\max}(x_i - x) + \frac{n-n_\epsilon}{n}\underset{i\in[n_\epsilon, n]}{\max}(x_i - x) \\
	&= \frac{n_\epsilon}{n}\underset{i\in[1,n_\epsilon]}{\max}(x_i - x) + \frac{\epsilon}{2}
\end{align*}
now if we choose $n > \frac{n_\epsilon \underset{i\in[1,n_\epsilon]}{\max}(x_i - x)}{\epsilon/2}$, then we can bound the RHS by $\epsilon$.

	We can use induction to show that $(y_n)$ is increasing. Since the sequence is increasing and starts at 1, we know that $(y_n)$ is bounded above by 4 and below by 0. Thus, by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, we conclude that $(y_n)$ converges. Now, we find the limit of the recurrence by taking the limits of both sides of the equation,
	\begin{align*}
		y &= 4 - \frac{1}{y} \\
		y^2 - 4y + 1 &= 0 \\

We can define the recurrence of this sequence as 
\begin{equation}
	a_{n+1} = \sqrt{2 a_{n}}.

We can prove by induction that this sequence is increasing. We can also bound the sequence since ???.

Taking the limits of both sides,
\begin{align*}
	a &= \sqrt{2a} \\
	a^2 - 2a &= 0\\
	a &= 2 \tag{from i.c. $a_0 = 1$}.

	\textbf{Base Case}: $x_1 = 2 \lra x_1^2 = 4 \geq 2$.
	
	\textbf{Inductive Hypothesis}: Given that for some $x_n, x_n^2 \geq 2$.
	
	\textbf{Inductive Step}: Consider

		&= \frac{\frac{1}{2}x_n^2-1}{x_n} \\

	Thus by the Monotone Convergence Theorem we know that $(x_n)$ converges. We now take limits of $x$ on both sides of the recurrence, yielding,
	\begin{align*}
		x &= \frac{1}{2}\pa{x + \frac{2}{x}} \\
		\frac{1}{2}x - \frac{1}{x} &= 0 \\
		x^2 - 2 &= 0 \\
		\lra x &= \sqrt{2}.

	\item Since we know that $(a_n)$ is bounded, it must also be the case that $\sup (a_n)$ is bounded. Then, $\sup\{a_k\}$ is a decreasing sequence, so by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, we know that $(y_n)$ converges.
